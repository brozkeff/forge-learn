# CLAUDE.md

Personal AI setup powered by plain text files.

## Identity

Read `steering/Identity.md` for the user's name, preferences, and experience level. Adjust your communication style accordingly.

Read `steering/Goals.md` for what the user is currently working toward. Reference their goals when suggesting projects or priorities.

Read any other `.md` files in `steering/` — the user may add custom rules or preferences there (e.g., `steering/MyRules.md`). Follow them.

## Skills

Skills are in `skills/*/SKILL.md`. Each skill is invoked by typing its name (e.g., `/Tour`, `/Explain`). Follow the instructions in each SKILL.md exactly.

## Conventions

- Explain before acting. Show what you'll do and ask for confirmation before making changes.
- Match the user's experience level. If Identity.md says "beginner", avoid jargon and use analogies.
- When something goes wrong, explain what happened and why before jumping to a fix.
- Keep responses concise. One clear paragraph beats three vague ones.

## Levels

This project has a 7-level progression. Read `steering/Levels.md` for the roadmap and current progress.

When the user seems stuck or asks what to do next, check their current level in Levels.md and suggest the next uncompleted step. The `/Progress` skill shows their level and guides them forward.

Skills are tagged by level but NOT gated — all skills work at any level. The levels guide the learning journey, not restrict access.

## Directory Structure

```
steering/    — who the user is (identity, goals)
skills/      — what you can do (invokable commands)
modules/     — optional add-ons (may be empty)
```
