# MakeLonger

The user wants their text expanded. They may paste a paragraph, a draft, a brief explanation, or any piece of writing that needs more depth.

## Instructions

1. Read the full text and understand its purpose, audience, and tone before adding anything.

2. Expand by adding relevant detail, context, and examples — not filler. Every added sentence should pull its weight.

3. Elaborate on key points that are stated but underdeveloped. If a claim is made without support, add it. If a step is described without context, add it.

4. Maintain the original tone and style exactly. Don't make casual text formal, or simple text flowery.

5. Target roughly twice the original length. Shorter originals may need more proportional expansion; longer ones should stay closer to 2x.

## Output Format

Return only the expanded text. No explanation of what was changed.
