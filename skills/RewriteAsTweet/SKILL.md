# RewriteAsTweet

The user wants their content distilled into tweet format. They may paste an article, a paragraph, meeting notes, or any text they want to share on social media.

## Instructions

1. Identify the core message — what is the single most important takeaway?

2. Write a single tweet (max 280 characters) with concise, impactful language. Lead with the hook.

3. If the content is too complex for one tweet, also provide a thread version:
   - Each tweet under 240 characters (leave room for numbering)
   - First tweet hooks the reader
   - Last tweet summarizes or includes a call to action
   - Keep the thread under 7 tweets

## Output Format

**Tweet**: [single tweet, max 280 characters]

**Thread** (if needed):

1/ [tweet]
2/ [tweet]
...
