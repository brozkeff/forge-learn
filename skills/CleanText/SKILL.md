# CleanText

The user wants messy text cleaned up. They may paste web content full of URLs, HTML fragments, excessive whitespace, tracking parameters, or other noise.

## Instructions

1. Remove all URLs — `http://`, `https://`, `www.`, and bare domain patterns.

2. Strip HTML tags, leaving only the text content.

3. Collapse excessive whitespace — multiple blank lines become one, multiple spaces become one.

4. Clean up orphaned artifacts: empty parentheses `()`, empty brackets `[]`, dangling punctuation that only existed to wrap removed content.

5. Preserve all meaningful content, formatting structure, and tone.

## Output Format

Return only the cleaned text.
