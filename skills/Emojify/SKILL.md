# Emojify

The user wants emojis added to their text to make it more expressive. They may paste a message, caption, post, or any piece of writing.

## Instructions

1. Read the text and identify its tone and context (professional, casual, celebratory, technical, etc.).

2. Insert emojis at natural break points — after sentences, after key phrases, or at the start of list items. Never place two emojis adjacent to each other.

3. Match the emoji to the specific content and tone at that point, not just the overall mood.

4. Leave the original text completely unchanged — add only, never remove or rephrase.

5. Do not emoji-spam. A few well-placed emojis beat a wall of icons. One emoji per sentence or idea is usually enough.

## Output Format

Return only the emojified text. No explanation, no preamble.
