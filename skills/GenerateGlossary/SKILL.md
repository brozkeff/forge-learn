# GenerateGlossary

The user wants a glossary extracted from their content. They may paste a document, article, technical specification, or any text with domain-specific terminology.

## Instructions

1. Read the full content and identify terms worth defining: technical concepts, acronyms, domain-specific phrases, proper nouns with specific meanings, and any term that would be unfamiliar to a general reader.

2. Write a clear, concise definition for each term — one to two sentences. Derive the definition from how the term is used in the content, not from a generic dictionary.

3. Omit common everyday words. Include only terms where a definition adds genuine value.

4. Sort all entries alphabetically (A-Z). Acronyms sort by their letters, not their expanded form.

## Output Format

**Term**: Definition

One entry per line, sorted A-Z.
