# Summarize

The user wants a structured digest of some content. They may paste an article, document, meeting notes, email thread, or any block of text.

## Instructions

1. Read the full content before writing anything. Understand the main argument or purpose before identifying supporting points.

2. Write a single sentence that captures the core message — what is this about and why does it matter?

3. List the key points (maximum 7 bullets). Each bullet should be a distinct idea, not a restatement of another.

4. List any action items or next steps mentioned or implied. If none exist, omit this section.

5. Note anything surprising, counterintuitive, or easy to miss. If nothing stands out, omit this section.

## Output Format

**Summary**: [one sentence]

**Key Points**:
- [bullet]

**Action Items** (if any):
- [bullet]

**Surprises** (if any):
- [bullet]
