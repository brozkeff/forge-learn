# MakeShorter

The user wants their text condensed. They may paste a paragraph, an email, a document section, or any piece of writing that needs trimming.

## Instructions

1. Read the full text and identify the main ideas — what must survive the cut?

2. Preserve all main ideas and key points. Nothing essential should be lost in the reduction.

3. Keep essential details — specifics that carry meaning, names, numbers, and core claims. Strip supporting padding, redundancy, and elaboration that restates what was already said.

4. Maintain the original tone and style. Don't reframe casual text as formal, or restructure the author's voice.

5. Target roughly half the original length. Don't pad to hit the target — if you can convey the meaning in less, stop there.

## Output Format

Return only the shortened text. No explanation of what was cut.
