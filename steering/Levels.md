# Levels

Your AI journey in seven steps. Each level introduces new capabilities. Type `/Progress` to see where you are and what to try next.

All skills work at every level — the levels guide your learning, not restrict your access.

---

## Level 1: Spark — Transform text with prompts

Paste text in, get transformed text back. No setup needed.

**Skills**: /ExplainSimply, /Summarize, /FixGrammar, /MakeShorter, /MakeLonger, /Translate, /Emojify, /CleanText, /GenerateGlossary

## Level 3: Navigate — Work with files and save your progress

Use the AI to understand files and save your work with git.

**Skills**: /GitHelp, /GenerateTOC

> **Privacy tip**: Your `steering/` files contain personal info (name, goals). If you push to a public repository, this becomes visible. Consider keeping your fork private or reviewing these files before pushing.

- [ ] Used /Explain on a file in your project
- [ ] Made your first git commit (try: /GitHelp save my progress)
- [ ] Used /GitHelp to check what changed or review your history

---

## Level 4: Build — Create something from an idea

Go from "I want to build X" to a working project.

**Skills**: /Kickstart, /FixIt, /RewriteAsTweet

- [ ] Used /Kickstart to plan a project from an idea
- [ ] Built at least one working project with files you created
- [ ] Used /FixIt to recover from a problem or /RewriteAsTweet to share your work

---

## Level 5: Steer — Control AI behavior with files

You already edited Identity.md to change how the AI talks to you. Now write custom rules and even your own skills.

**Skills**: /Progress (to track your journey)

- [ ] Created a custom rule file in steering/ (e.g., `steering/MyRules.md` with "always use British spelling")
- [ ] Created your own skill in skills/ (a SKILL.md file — look at existing skills for the pattern)
- [ ] Tested that your rule or skill changes AI behavior

---

## Level 6: Connect — Expand with modules

Install optional forge modules to give your AI new capabilities.

- [ ] Browsed available modules at github.com/N4M3Z
- [ ] Installed a module into modules/ and asked your AI to set it up
- [ ] Used a skill from the installed module

---

## Level 7: Forge — Enhance the ecosystem

Everything you've learned comes together. Improve a module that others use.

- [ ] Read an existing module's source code and understood its skills
- [ ] Identified an improvement — better wording, a missing edge case, a new skill idea
- [ ] Shared your enhancement with the module author (PR, issue, or direct message)
